# School_District_Analysis

### Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to investigate the math and readings scores at Thomas High School and compare them to the district to see if there is any evidence of academic dishonesty. By replacing the math and reading data for Thomas High School students and running with non-values, this created a comparative set of data against the district, which allows us to describe our findings in detail below.

### How is the district summary affected?

The district summary data showed a quite small decrease in scores with the overall passing only decreasing by 0.3%.

#### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Originally, the data showed that Thomas High School was very much in line with other charter schools. Once the 9th grade scores were replaced, the school became the worst performing charter school by almost 25% overall passing rate.

##### Scores by school spending
##### Scores by school size
##### Scores by school type
Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
